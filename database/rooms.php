    Description:
    *This is a database of planets that are in the game. 

    Helpful Information:
    *Each planet and room should have a different ID.
	*ID's should not change.
	*Planet information isn't used anywhere as of now.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Template ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *Create a room
    $rooms[] = new Room(ID,"NAME","DESCRIPTION");
    *Example: $rooms[] = new Room(99, "My Room", "My Room Description);

    *Add a thing at a time into the room
    $rooms[ID]->addEntity( MapItem::create(ITEM_ID,AMOUNT,"X,Y","IMAGE") );
    *Add more things at once into the room
    $rooms[ID]->addEntities( array(
